## üìä Key Insights
Fraudulent transactions are significantly skewed compared to normal transactions.

Transaction type and amount patterns play a major role in detecting fraud.

Random Forest provided a strong balance between precision and recall without unrealistic 100% performance.

Feature engineering, such as creating time-based features, improved model interpretability.
## Business Impact
Helps banks and payment platforms reduce financial losses from fraudulent transactions.

Improves customer trust by proactively flagging suspicious activity.

Allows real-time monitoring when deployed into production systems.
